<hr><h2>Homework One: Employee Class Practice</h2><p>The first homework in this class was some basic practice with objects, entitled Employee, with a tester class called Company.</p>
<a href=https://github.com/Healdb/CS-112/tree/master/Employee>The files for the project can be found here.</a>
<p>My opinion: So far this class has been relatively easy and mostly review. I have spoken with the professor and apparently the only difference between this class and the AP CS course is that this course covers some basic Java graphics. Apparently, some have moved up to the 200 level of classes, maybe I will have to move up! Only time will tell I guess.</p>
