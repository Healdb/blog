<hr><h2>Homework One: Employee Class And Object Practice</h2><p>The first homework in this class was some basic practice with objects, entitled Employee, with a tester class called Company.</p>

<p>My opinion: So far this class has been relatively easy and mostly review. I have spoken with the professor and apparently the only difference between this class and the AP CS course is that this course covers some basic Java graphics. Apparently, some have moved up to the 200 level of classes, maybe I will have to move up! Only time will tell I guess.</p>
<hr><h2>Homework Two: ShuffleMusicPlayer Class And Object Inheritance</h2><p>The second homework in this class had us working with some java graphics, which I was surprised to find were very simple. It also deals with some basic object inheritance from the Playlist class to the ShufflePlaylist class. The overall goal of the homework was to make a small little graphics application, though the only thing we had to do was extend the PLaylis object to enable the Shuffle feature of the application.</p>

<p>My opinion: This lesson was actually somewhat interesting! I'm glad we've moved onto some graphics work, and some more complicated object-related topics like inheritance. Hopefully soon we will be moving on to even more complicated topics, as I was able to do this pretty quickly.</p>
